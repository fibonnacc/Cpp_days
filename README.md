## 🎵 Polymorphism with Pure Virtual Functions in C++

This example demonstrates how **polymorphism** allows different objects (`Piano`, `Accordion`) to share the same interface (`Instrument`) but behave differently when executing the same method (`makeSound()`).

### 🧩 Code Overview

```cpp
class Instrument {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Accordion : public Instrument {
public:
    void makeSound() const override {
        std::cout << "Accordion playing...\n";
    }
};

class Piano : public Instrument {
public:
    void makeSound() const override {
        std::cout << "Piano playing...\n";
    }
};

int main() {
  Instrument* instruments[80];

  for (int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      instruments[i] = new Piano();
    }
    else {
      instruments[i] = new Accordion();
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    instruments[i]->makeSound();
    delete instruments[i];
  }
}
```

Here, `Instrument` defines the **interface**, and both `Accordion` and `Piano` **implement** the sound behavior differently.

### ⚙️ Runtime Behavior (Animation Style)

When your program runs:

```
🎼 Creating instruments...

Slot[0] → 🎹 Piano
Slot[1] → 🪗 Accordion
Slot[2] → 🎹 Piano
Slot[3] → 🪗 Accordion
     ⋮

🎶 Playing all instruments...
---------------------------------
[0] → Piano playing...
[1] → Accordion playing...
[2] → Piano playing...
[3] → Accordion playing...
      ⋮
```

💡 Even though each object is stored as an `Instrument*`,
the **correct derived class function** (`Piano::makeSound()` or `Accordion::makeSound()`) is called dynamically.

---

### 🧠 What You Learn from This Code

* 🔸 How to declare and use a **pure virtual function** to enforce a common interface.
* 🔸 How **virtual functions** enable **runtime polymorphism** (dynamic dispatch).
* 🔸 Why you **can’t instantiate** an abstract class directly (`Instrument` in this case).
* 🔸 How arrays of base-class pointers can manage many different derived objects seamlessly.
* 🔸 The power of designing extensible systems — adding a new instrument only requires defining its `makeSound()`.

---

### 💡 Bonus Tip

You could extend this system easily:

```cpp
class Guitar : public Instrument {
public:
    void makeSound() const override {
        std::cout << "Guitar strumming...\n";
    }
};
```

Now every place using `Instrument*` will automatically support `Guitar` without changing other code.
That’s **true polymorphism**.

🎯 The Core Idea
Just like a company cannot hire a generic "Employee" without knowing what specific role they fulfill, C++ uses abstract classes to prevent the creation of vague, undefined objects.

📋 The Employee Contract
The Employee abstract class defines a mandatory contract that all specific employee types must fulfill:

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    virtual void doWork() = 0;         // Every employee MUST work
    virtual void attendMeeting() = 0;  // Every employee MUST attend meetings  
    virtual double getSalary() = 0;    // Every employee MUST have a salary
};
```
🔒 What Makes It Abstract:
Pure virtual functions (= 0 syntax)

Cannot create Employee objects directly - the class represents a concept, not a concrete entity

Forces derived classes to implement all required methods

👥 Concrete Implementations
💻 Developer Role

```cpp
class Developer : public Employee {
public:
    void doWork() override { cout << "Writing code\n"; }           // Specific work
    void attendMeeting() override { cout << "Tech standup\n"; }   // Specific meetings
    double getSalary() override { return 80000; }                 // Specific salary
};
```

👨‍💼 Manager Role

```cpp
class Manager : public Employee {
public:
    void doWork() override { cout << "Managing team\n"; }         // Specific work
    void attendMeeting() override { cout << "Strategy meeting\n"; } // Specific meetings
    double getSalary() override { return 120000; }                // Specific salary
};
```

🚫 What You CANNOT Do

```cpp
Employee genericEmployee;  // ❌ COMPILER ERROR!
// Cannot create abstract class objects - just like you can't hire "just an employee"
```

✅ What You CAN Do
```cpp
Employee* dev = new Developer();   // ✅ Hire a specific developer
Employee* mgr = new Manager();     // ✅ Hire a specific manager

// Use them polymorphically:
dev->doWork();    // Output: "Writing code"
mgr->doWork();    // Output: "Managing team"
```

🌟 Key Benefits
Enforced Consistency - All employee types must implement the same core functions

Prevents Ambiguity - No vague "generic employees" can exist

Flexible Extensibility - Easy to add new roles (Designer, Analyst, etc.)

Polymorphic Power - Treat different employee types uniformly through the base interface

🏗️ Real-World Parallel
This pattern is used extensively in:

Payment systems (different gateways with same interface)

Database connectors (different databases with same operations)

Game development (different game objects with same lifecycle methods)

Plugin architectures (different plugins with same entry points)

The abstract class ensures that every "employee" in your system has well-defined responsibilities and capabilities, making your code more robust and maintainable.
